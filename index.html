      <a href="http://datproject.org">Dat</a> is a non-profit organization that develops open source data tools for scientists.
      These are some of the technologies we use to make this possible.

        <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive">Hyperdrive</a> is peer to peer directories.
        Moving files between computers on a planet-scale system was never easier. We built this to efficiently share terabytes of scientific data in real time between research institutions on multiple continents, but it should work fine to share a text file on your the local network too.

        <a href="https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore">Hypercore</a> is secure distributed streams that just work.
        Using cryptography, streaming binary data to other computers is as easy as sharing a key.
        This creates an efficient gossip network where latency is reduced to a minimum.

        We are an eventually consistent, highly available, partition tolerant system so don’t worry about taking your local of data
        offline for a bit – we’ve got your back.
